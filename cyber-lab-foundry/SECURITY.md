# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The lab is intended for local, educational use. We aim to support the latest
minor release of each container image. Security updates are delivered via
container rebuilds and configuration patches.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please email security@cyberlab.local with the following details:

* Description of the issue and potential impact
* Steps to reproduce
* Any suggested mitigation
* Your availability for follow-up questions

We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and provide status updates at
least weekly until resolution. When appropriate, we will coordinate a private
fix before public disclosure.

## PGP

We currently do not publish a PGP key. If you require encrypted communication,
include that request in your initial email.
